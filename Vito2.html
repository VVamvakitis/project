         <h1>Example 1</h1>
         <h2>Living up to Expectations</h2>
         <p>
             One example of my life experience is to live up to your expectatiosn. I am the 5 time chess chaption at my school and wanted to live up the the expetation that you need to always win. The truth is that if you are expected to do something you need to do it. <br>
            For example, when I was in the 9th grade, I almost lost the chess tourniment. I got to the Semi Finals in a double elmininaiton tourniment wit no losses. I lost to an eight grader and was put in the loser bracket. I had to come back and win 3 straight game to win the tourniment. But, before i arrived for the seccond day, was taunted and tessed by everyone and everyone was against me at the time. I had no support and had to study and win by myself. The moral of the story is to prefect what you are good at and live up to expectations with either what people think of you, or what you think of yourself.

         <h1>Example 2</h1>
         <h2>Not Living up to Expectations</h2>
         <p>
            As I could easily explain how the previous example could be not living up to expectation, I will explain another example. I was not the best student in the World. I consistently get in trouble and pray I wouldn't get caught. One time I was given a seccodn chance. One time I had lost everything and my headmaster at the time was going to give me a seccodn chance. He made it very clear that this could be my last chance. I was perfect for 2 weeks until, I got caught. I was showing off and trying to follow rule 21 of the <a href="vito1.html">V-Code.</a> I punched a hole in the wall and a friend of mine was filming the entire thing. I couldn't even dig a deaper hole by telling a lie. I had to confront my headmaster and tell him I proved him wrong.  I would - for the rest of that year - earn all privileges and lose them on the same day. I would not be able to maintain ny honors until my juinor year of high school.
